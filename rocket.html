    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Tech - A minimalist palette using warm neutrals (slate/zinc), an off-white background, and a muted cyan accent for a clean, modern, and harmonious feel. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A user-centric, task-oriented SPA design. Instead of a linear report, the core is an interactive "Racket Explorer" with filters (weight, style, brand) and a detailed card view. This allows users to immediately find relevant rackets. Supporting sections, "Knowledge Base" and "Expert's Choice," provide context and guidance, mirroring a user's journey from learning to selection. This non-linear structure prioritizes quick comparison and personalized discovery over passive reading. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Racket specs (weight, balance, stiffness, max lbs) -> Goal: Compare -> Viz: Interactive card grid, dynamic Chart.js bar chart for direct comparison. || Report Info: All rackets' weight/balance data -> Goal: Relationships -> Viz: Interactive Chart.js scatter plot to show design trends (e.g., light-weight + head-heavy). || Report Info: Concepts (balance point, stiffness) -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: Diagrams built with HTML/CSS divs and transforms for a lightweight, interactive explanation. || JUSTIFICATION: This approach transforms static tables and text into a dynamic, explorable system. Chart.js (Canvas) is used for all data visualization, and HTML/CSS for diagrams, strictly adhering to the NO SVG/Mermaid constraint. Interactions like filtering, selecting, and viewing details empower the user. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
